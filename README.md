## Choices rationale
- **Tweak:** the simple **tweak** is used since it has been proven to be the most effective compared to **probabilistic tweak** and **multiple_mutation_tweak**
- **Restart:** a **restart** mechanism is used since it has been proven to be the most effective compared to no **restart**, although the number of **restarts** is quite low w.r.t. the number of iterations.
- **Simulated Annealing:** the simulated annealing **hyper-parameters** have been chosen through a process of trial and error. Just like **restart**, the number of **iterations** is quite low w.r.t. the number of iterations, however it has been proven to increase the performance of the system.
  
## Contributors
Some techniques implemented in my proposal were discussed and developed jointly with my [colleague]( https://github.com/FerraiuoloP/).
We started from the same template, then we discussed how simulated annealing would work in our scenario and we sort of implemented it together(although our versions differ).
